# Hill Cipher

A header-only basic Hill Cipher implementation modulo 97 (all characters commonly found on a QWERTY keyboard, including a-z, A-Z, 0-9, all symbols, tab, and newline). Since 97 is prime, Z/97 is a field, which is convenient.

Uses my two header-only implementations of [integers modulo N](https://gitlab.com/mathnerd/integers-modulo-n) and [minimal matrix](https://gitlab.com/mathnerd/minimal-matrix).
